I am a bioinformatician / postdoctoral researcher working at the lab of Dr. Sarah Schaack. My research is focused on estimating mutation rates from genomic data of *Daphnia magna* lines. Our aim is to understand how much mutation rates varies between genotypes/populations and mutation types as well as their genomic effects.
