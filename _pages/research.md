    title: "Variation in Mutation Rates"
    excerpt: "Mutations are the ultimate source of genetic variation. Although it has become easier to obtain good estimate of mutation rates, we still know very little about how these rates vary within and between species. My research utilizes bioinformatic analyses to estimate the mutations rates for different types of mutations (single nucleotide substitutions, indels, copy number variants, microsatellites, transposable elements) from mutation accumulation lines of *Daphnia magna*. I have found significant intraspecific variation in mutations rates between genotypes and populations as well as between the nuclear and mitochondrial genome ([Ho *et al.*, 2020]( https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msaa142)). It is also becoming clear that rates for different mutation types do not strongly covary across genotypes (([Ho *et al.*, 2019]( https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msz118))). These results have implications for the evolution of mutation rates and their impacts on the genome."
