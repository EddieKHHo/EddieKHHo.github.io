This as my personal website and a place to post hobby projects related to machine learning, bioinformatics, population genetics, and coding. I am constantly learning new methodologies/technologies to better analyze data and my philosophy for self-education has always been the same: experiment, construct pet projects, fail, fix, and repeat!  Please check out the pages on this site to learn more about my work and my interests.

### Background

I am a bioinformatician / postdoctoral researcher working at the lab of Dr. Sarah Schaack. My research is focused on estimating mutation rates from genomic data of *Daphnia magna* lines. Our aim is to analyze how mutation rates vary between genotypes/populations and mutation types as well as their genomic effects.

I received my Ph.D. in Evolutionary Genetics at the University of Toronto in 2017, under advisor Dr. Aneil Agrawal. Here, I studied the population genetic/genomic consequences of uniparental reproduction using a combination of biological experiments, mathematical theory, computer simulations, and bioinformatics.

### Hobbies

In my spare time, I enjoy reading non-fiction on topics related to astrophysics and quantum mechanics, taking care of my pets (ant colonies, triops, fish, snails) and succulents, and 3D printing useless junk.
